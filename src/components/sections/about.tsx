                {`I'm a full-stack web developer based in Singapore. 
                With over five years of experience in the industry, I specialize in creating responsive and 
                user-friendly websites that help businesses achieve their goals. 
                I'm passionate about using technology to solve problems and I'm always looking for new challenges to tackle. 
                When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking in the mountains or trying out new recipes in the kitchen. 
                Thanks for visiting my portfolio and I look forward to connecting with you!`}
